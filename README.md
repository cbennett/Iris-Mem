# Iris-Mem
The repository includes files which implement online regression on a standard task (Iris database) using a learning set up and rule which is appropriate for on-chip learning with emerging memory devices.
The proposed implementation uses dressed nanowires which act as enhanced flash memory via molecularly enhanced floating gates. Said devices can be programmed in a bipolar mode above characteristic  thresholds via the third terminal (gate).
The model can easily be extended to other device models, though.
